*Psst — looking for a more complete solution? Check out [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev), the official framework for building web applications of all sizes, with a beautiful development experience and flexible filesystem-based routing.*

*Looking for a shareable component template instead? You can [use SvelteKit for that as well](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#packaging) or the older [sveltejs/component-template](https://github.com/sveltejs/component-template)*

# JXWord Creator

A Crossword Puzzle Creator for use with JXWord.

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see your app running.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies` so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms like [Heroku](https://heroku.com).
